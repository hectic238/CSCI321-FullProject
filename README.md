# PlanIt - Local Event Planner and Finder

PlanIt is a web-based event planner system that allows users to create, explore, and manage events.  
The application consists of a **React frontend** and an **ASP.NET 8 backend**, using **AWS DynamoDB** for data storage, and Auth0 for authentication.

## üìå Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js]
- [npm]
- [.NET 8 SDK]

- [JetBrains Rider] or [Visual Studio] (optional)


## üèÉ Running the Project

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend (ASP.NET 8) & Front End (React)**
#### üõ†Ô∏è **Run Project Locally in Command Line**

When the Backend is run locally

#### Make a directory for the self-signed SSL certificate

mkdir "%APPDATA%\ASP.NET\https"  

#### Change Directory to Backend

cd to CSCI321-FullProject\CSCI321.Server  
#### Install dependencies
dotnet restore  
#### Build the project
dotnet build   
#### Start the backend
dotnet run      

#### Visit Website
https://localhost:5173/home

## üîë  Security Considerations:

During the development and testing phases of this project, the website was accessed using a self-signed SSL certificate, which resulted in a "Not Secure" browser warning. This was a temporary measure to enable HTTPS testing without incurring costs for a trusted certificate.

In a real-world production environment, the following steps would be taken to ensure full SSL security:

Register a custom domain name.

Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue a trusted SSL certificate.

Set up an Elastic Load Balancer to terminate SSL at the load balancer level.

These steps would ensure end-to-end encryption, secure connections, and improved user trust.
